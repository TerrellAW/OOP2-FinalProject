    TODO: Create a Calendar using three lists and CSS:
    - List 1: Months, dependent on enum
    - List 2: Days, dependent on enum
    - List 3: Dates, numbers dependent on System.DateOnly and matching datetime format from API
    - CSS: Use CSS to style Calendar
        > Month on top
        > Days under Month spread out horizontally
        > Dates properly appearing under their corresponding day

    Interactive, can switch months and click on days.
    When a day is clicked:
        - Display a button to enter New Event page
        - Display Weather for that day or "Weather not available for this day"
        - Highlight Days with future Event
            > If Day has event, display button to enter EventViewer page for that Day instead
            > If Day has past event, display button to enter EventHistory for that Day instead

    Create Calendar here so it can be reused as a component.

    FOR Ishamjot:
    Focus on the CSS, enums and dates haven't been set up yet but you can set them up if you want/have time.
    See if you can make each day a button that can be clicked.
